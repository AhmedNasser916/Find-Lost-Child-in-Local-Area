These days we face a big problem that impacts negatively our society. Most children
being missed or kidnapped from their families. The New York Times reported that every
hour, four children go missing in the country with close to half of them remaining
untraced. Last year, 49% of the 36,740 children who went missing could not be traced.
The percentage of untraced children for previous years indicates a worsening trend. In
2011, 38% of the 90,654 children who went missing remained untraced; the
corresponding percentages were 41.35 in 2012 and 50.91 in 2013.





Our project aims to try to find these children in a local area and send them back to their
families. We target phones as it’s easy to use them and anyone these days has a smart
phone. We made our app works in a local area and we selected the malls as a begin to our
project, cause we can control the area of the mall instead of a public street where we don’t
have a lot of cameras.




Our project simply will be a mobile application which will help you to know the place of
your child. The app can be used by parents to report missing their child or by any vigilant
citizen who can report any vulnerable child on the mall. The app will take the child image,
then detect the child face from it, then compare images in the database with the child
image, trying to find the missing child by matching images. Also, the app works with
surveillance systems if any camera detected any missing child and identifies him by
comparing his face with the missing child, it will send a notification to his parents with
his location.
