We have tried to reduce human effort by using surveillance cameras and face recognition.
The system makes use of real-time analysis of video captured by the surveillance camera to detect the most recent presence of missing child.

These days we face a big problem that impacts negatively our society. Most children
being missed or kidnapped from their families.

Our project aims to try to find these children in a local area and send them back to their
families. We target phones as it’s easy to use them and anyone these days has a smart
phone. We made our app works in a local area and we selected the malls as a begin to our
project, cause we can control the area of the mall instead of a public street where we don’t have a lot of cameras.

------
#### Tools
 - - Five cameras
      - - - Camera on the entrance “detecting and store children faces”
      - - - Camera on the exit gate “detecting and store children faces”
      - - - 3 Cameras around the mall.
 - - Desktop for security man.
 - - Application for user and security man.

Our project simply will be a mobile application which will help you to know the place of
your child. The app can be used by parents to report missing their child or by any vigilant
citizen who can report any vulnerable child on the mall. The app will take the child image,
then detect the child face from it, then compare images in the database with the child
image, trying to find the missing child by matching images. Also, the app works with
surveillance systems if any camera detected any missing child and identifies him by
comparing his face with the missing child, it will send a notification to his parents with
his location.
